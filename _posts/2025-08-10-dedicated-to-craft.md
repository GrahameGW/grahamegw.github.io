It's hard to escape the sense in this day and age that craft and quality just aren't important. Call it late-stage capitalism, call it the inevitable result of the "growth above all" mindset, blame it on leadership obsessed with their own enrichment and petty vendettas&mdash;whatever the cause the value of craft is quietly wilting in the background.

Despite the general societal mood (or even perhaps because of it!) there are people and organizations prioritizing craft and quality. I've started a list so I don't forget these things exist. It feels vanishingly small right now because that's how things feel right now; I look forward to growing it with examples hopefully provided by all of you.
